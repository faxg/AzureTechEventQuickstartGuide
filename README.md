## Prepare your Bonsai Workspace in the Microsoft Azure Cloud
You will need a Microsoft Azure account (Trial would be enough).
Please prepare the following steps __before__ the workshop:
- **https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/guides/account-setup**
- After that, you should be able to access the Bonsai Workspace at: (https://preview.bons.ai/)


Never used Azure before?
We recommend: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/

__Hint__: 
If English is not your first language, try changing the language code in URLS - `/en-us/` to `/de-de/` (for example). 
Works for most `*.microsoft.com` pages, including docs and learn tutorials.
If you omit the language segment, it will use your browser default language.
