## Getting Started with Microsoft Azure
If you want to get the best Developer experience, you'll need to following:
- GitHub account (https://github.com)
- Microsoft Azure account (https://portal.azure.com) 

You can also log-in to Azure using your existing __GitHub account__


It's best to use your private e-mail for the accounts, e.g. not your work or university e-mail, as this could lead to some problems with free Azure Credits etc.

Never used Azure before?
We recommend: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/

__Hint__: 
If English is not your first language, try changing `/en-us/` to `/de-de/` (for example). Works for most `*.microsoft.com` pages, including docs and learn tutorials.




## Get Free Azure Credits (Azure Passes)
We provide __100$ / 90-days__ free credits, so that you can use Azure for free on your prototype. 
These "Azure Passes" come in the form of __promo codes__ and need to be redeemed on a special website. Afterwards you should get a "Azure Sponsored Subscription" in your account.

__Important__: You only need ONE per team.

* Go to: __https://aka.ms/HSLUDevSecOps/AzurePasses__
* Copy the voucher code and then click “=> Get on board with Azure”
